**Rhubarb Pie**  
Serves 2-4

Equipment: 4.5" pie pan

**Ingredients**1 Pie Crust (recipe is below)  
2 1/2 cups rhubarb, sliced 1/4" thick  
1/3 cup sugar  
2 1/2 T. flour  
1/2 t. cinnamon (I used Penzey's Pumpkin Pie Spice)  
3/4 T. butter

1\. Heat oven to 425°F.

2\. In a large bowl, blend the rhubarb, sugar, flour and cinnamon. Pour into the crust-lined pie pan. Dot with butter.

3\. Roll out the crusts. Dab the rim of the bottom crust with water to create a glue. Then place the top crust over the rhubarb; trim, seal and cut several vents. Bake for 15 minutes; reduce the temperature to 350°F and bake 25 to 30 minutes more, or until a bit of pink juice bubbles from the vents in the crust.

**Pie Crust **  
from [For Love of the Table][0]

1 1/3 cup unbleached all-purpose flour (150 grams/5 1/3 oz.)  
1 stick chilled, unsalted butter (113.5 grams/4 oz.)  
3/8 t. salt  
2 to 4 T. ice water (28 to 56 grams/1 to 2 oz.)

Combine the flour and the salt in a medium-sized bowl. Rub the butter into the flour until the butter is in small pea-sized pieces. Drizzle 2 T. ice water over the flour/butter mixture. Using your hands, fluff the mixture until it begins to clump, adding more water if necessary. If, when you squeeze some of the mixture it holds together, the dough is finished. Turn the dough out onto a counter and form into a mound. Using the heel of your hand, gradually push all of the dough away from you in short forward strokes, flattening out the lumps. Continue until all of the dough is flat. Using a bench scraper, scrape the dough off the counter, forming it into a single clump as you do. Divide the clump of dough into two pieces, and wrap each piece in plastic wrap, pressing the dough into a thick disk. Chill for at least 30 minutes.

To roll out a bottom crust, let one of the disks of dough warm up for a moment or two. Butter and flour a 4.5-inch pie plate and set it aside. Flour the work surface and the rolling pin. Begin rolling from the center of the dough outward. After each stroke, rotate the dough a quarter turn---always making sure that there is sufficient flour to keep the dough from sticking. Keep rolling and turning until you have a round of dough that is about 1/8 to 1/6 --inch in thickness. Using a lid or an upside-down bowl, trim the dough to form a 12-inch circle. Brush off the excess flour and fold the dough circle in half. Slide the outspread fingers of both hands under the dough and gently lift it and transfer it to the prepared pie plate. Unfold the dough and ease it into the pan being careful not to stretch it. Chill the pie shell for at least 30 minutes.

Roll out the top crust. Trim the dough as for the bottom crust. Chill on a cookie sheet for at least 30 minutes.
