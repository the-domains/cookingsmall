**Spaghetti & Meatballs**

adapted from [smittenkitchen][0]

**Meatball Ingredients**  
1⁄2 lb. ground beef and pork mixed  
1⁄3 cup fresh bread crumbs or 1/2 cup panko  
2 T. milk  
1 T. finely chopped parsley  
1 T. finely grated Parmesan or Romano cheese  
1/4 t. Penzey's Sandwich Sprinkle  
1/2 t. coarse or kosher salt  
Pinch of red pepper flakes or few grinds of black pepper  
1⁄4 t. mustard   
1⁄4 t. Worcestershire sauce  
1 large egg  
1 T. olive oil  
8 oz. tomato puree or crushed tomatoes

**Preparation**  
1\. Place meat, crumbs, milk, parsley, cheese, Sandwich Sprinkle, pepper, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and egg in a large bowl. Mix all of this together with a fork, which does a good job of breaking up the eggs and chunks of meat. Form mixture into 1 1/2 to 2-inch meatballs and arrange on a plate. Refrigerate for 30 minutes.

2\. In a skillet, warm 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add tomatoes (beware the splatter!) and season with salt. Let mixture simmer over low heat for about 10 minutes (with a thicker puree) or 20 (for crushed tomatoes, which are usually more watery), stirring occasionally.

3\. With stove on the lowest heat possible to maintain a gentle simmer, add meatballs to sauce one by one, and cover with a lid. It will be hard but please don't touch or move them for at least 20 minutes of the 25-minute cooking time, so that they have a chance to keep their shape. Meatballs should be fully cooked through at 25 minutes, but it cannot hurt to cut one and half to verify.

4\. Yield: 8 medium-sized meatballs

5\. Make pasta according to your own specifications and add the meatballs and sauce. I top with freshly grated parmesan and some chiffonade basil.
